 * @brief High-level executor that manages task distribution to a ThreadPool.

 * with automatic dependency management. It handles:
 * - Automatic reachability computation for task dependencies
 * - Topological sorting of tasks based on dependencies
 * - Task submission to the underlying thread pool
 *
 * Usage:
 * @code
 * ThreadPoolExecutor executor;
 * executor.add_task(&task1);
 * executor.add_task(&task2);
 * executor.run();
 * executor.wait();
 * @endcode
