/**
 * @brief A fixed-size thread pool for concurrent task execution.
 *
 * ThreadPool provides a thread-safe mechanism for submitting and executing
 * callable tasks across a fixed number of worker threads. It supports
 * task queuing, completion notification, and graceful shutdown.
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - Task queue is protected by a shared_mutex for concurrent reads
 * - Worker coordination uses mutex and condition variable
 * - Active task count is atomic for lock-free queries
 *
 * Usage:
 * @code
 * ThreadPool pool{4};  // 4 worker threads
 * pool.run();          // Start workers
 * pool.add_task([]{ <task logic> });
 * pool.wait();         // Wait for completion
 * @endcode
