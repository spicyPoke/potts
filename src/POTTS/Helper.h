/**
 * @brief Computes reachability for a collection of tasks.
 *
 * This function computes the reachability (dependency depth) for all tasks
 * in the given range. Reachability represents the longest path from a task
 * to any of its dependency in the dependency graph.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Creates a shared traverse marker to track visited nodes
 * 2. For each task in the range, calls set_reachability() with the marker
 * 3. The marker ensures shared dependencies are not counted multiple times
 *
 * @tparam TaskRange A range type containing pointers to tasks (Task*, ITask*, etc.)
 * @param tasks A range of task pointers
 *
 * @note Must be called before task execution to enable proper topological sorting.
 *
 * Usage:
 * @code
 * std::vector<ITask*> tasks = {&task1, &task2, &task3};
 * potts::compute_reachability(tasks);
 * // Now tasks can be sorted by reachability and executed
 * @endcode
